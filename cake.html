    <h1>Creamy Chocolate Cake</h1>
    <h3>Rich and moist chocolate cake perfect for any occasion!</h3>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p>All-purpose flour</p></li>
        <li><p>Granulated sugar</p></li>
        <li><p>Unsweetened cocoa powder</p></li>
        <li><p>Espresso powder</p></li>
        <li><p>Canola oil</p></li>
        <li><p>Sour cream</p></li>
        <li><p>Whole milk</p></li>
        <li><p>Vanilla Extract</p></li>
        <li><p>Mini chocolate chips</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Line two 6” round cake pans with parchment paper and grease well, 
            then set them aside. I like to line them by tracing the bottom of the 
            cake pans onto parchment paper and then drawing “handles” out of 
            opposite sides. This makes it very easy to lift the cake 
            out after baking.</p></li>

        <li><p>In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, 
            baking powder, sea salt and espresso powder. Set aside to use later. 
            This step is important to ensure the ingredients are evenly 
            distributed and that there are no lumps.</p></li>

        <li><p>Next, combine the wet ingredients. In a large bowl, whisk together 
            canola oil, eggs, sour cream, milk and vanilla until the mixture is 
            smooth.</p></li>

        <li><p>Once the wet ingredients are combined, add the dry ingredients and 
            stir until the batter is smooth.</p></li>

        <li><p>Stir in the mini chocolate chip until evenly distributed.</p></li>

        <li><p>Next, divide the batter evenly into the two prepared cake pans. 
            You can either eyeball it or actually measure.</p></li>

        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick 
            inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean or with a few 
            crumbs.</p></li>

        <li><p>Place cake pans on a wire cooling rack to cool to room temperature 
            (takes about 30 minutes). Once cool, lift cakes out of the pans and 
            remove parchment paper. Let cool completely on the wire cooling rack.
        </p></li>

        <li><p>Once the cakes are completely cooled, frost or decorate them any 
            way you wish. I either use this chocolate frosting or this vanilla 
            frosting to make our chocolate birthday cakes!  Don’t forget to do 
            a crumb coat first – a thin base layer of frosting to keep crumbs 
            from getting into your final design.</p></li>
